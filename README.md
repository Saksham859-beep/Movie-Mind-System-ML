# Movie-Mind-System-ML
Movie Mind System is an intelligent movie recommendation engine built using machine learning techniques to help users discover movies that perfectly match their taste and interests. The system analyzes movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and overview to generate accurate and meaningful recommendations.
The project uses content-based filtering, where recommendations are generated by measuring similarity between movies rather than relying on user ratings. Textual data is converted into numerical form using vectorization techniques, and similarity between movies is calculated using cosine similarity.
Tools & Technologies Used

🔹 Programming & Libraries

Python – Core programming language

NumPy – Numerical computations

Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and utilities

CountVectorizer

Cosine Similarity

🔹 Web & UI

Streamlit – Interactive and responsive web interface

HTML/CSS (optional) – UI customization

🔹 Dataset

TMDB Movie Dataset – Movie metadata including genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview

⚙️ Method of Approach
1️⃣ Data Collection

Movie data is collected from the TMDB dataset containing metadata such as movie titles, genres, cast, keywords, and descriptions.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Removal of null values and unnecessary columns

Conversion of list-based data into readable text

Text normalization (lowercasing, removing spaces, etc.)

3️⃣ Feature Engineering

Important features (genres, cast, keywords, overview) are combined into a single column

Text data is transformed into numerical vectors using Count Vectorization

4️⃣ Similarity Calculation

Cosine similarity is used to measure closeness between movies

Higher similarity score indicates more relevant recommendations

5️⃣ Recommendation Generation

When a user selects a movie, the system identifies the most similar movies

Top recommended movies are displayed to the user

6️⃣ User Interface Development

Streamlit is used to build a clean and interactive UI

Users can select a movie and instantly receive recommendations

🎯 Applications

Personalized movie discovery platforms

Learning recommendation system concepts

Academic mini & major projects

Portfolio and resume enhancement
